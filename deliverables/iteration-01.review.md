# CodeLens

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 13th
 * Where: Room 2270

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Discussing ideas and voting on them as a group
   * This allowed us to express our interest in pursuing ideas and raise our reservations of each idea.
   * We had a lot of ideas initially, so by working together we were able to identify which ideas we really like and which ideas were not feasible.
 * Contacting the TA often
   * Getting regular feedback from the TA allowed us to evaluate our ideas and decide how to change them earlier in the iteration.
 * Switching to Slack
   * Slack allows us to use integrations like Trello and Github. This is a huge quality of life upgrade because everything is one place. We can see updates to our Trello board and our repository from the slack group.
   * We switched from Messenger to Slack because it was easier to organize our thoughts and Slack has more built-in features for collaboration like pinned messages and consolidated uploaded files. Finding old links and files in Messanger was a pain.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Anonymous voting on decisions
   * Initially we voted on ideas anonymously. This made it more difficult in the case of tie.
   * Voters did not understand each idea because they weren't proposed in-person at first.
   * We were not sure why people voted the way they did. It wasn't until we did the vote in-person that we were able to come to a conclusion.
 * Trying to get every member to pitch an idea
   * This resulted in an abundance of ideas. Many were dead in the water and we wasted a fair bit of time deciding which would be feasible.
 * Meeting only once a week
   * It turned out that one meeting once a week simply wasn't enough time for us to dwell on ideas and consider what people would enjoy working on/what made the project good. Changing our meetings to twice a week (and remotely over Slack) allowed us to flush out our ideas better.
 * Using Google Docs
   * We figured that using Google Docs would be easier since each user can make changes live without any conflicts. This was a bad idea because we had to migrate the information to Github anyway.
   * Google Docs also has poor version control, something we make use of often when reverting changes. 

#### Planned changes
  
 * We should have regular but shorter meetings instead of one long weekly meeting. This will help all group members to stay on track, and make sure that we agree on where the whole project is heading.
 * We should lower our expectations. During this iteration, we spent a lot of time on some ideas that were too ambitious for a two-months project. We could improve productivity by doing small steps. 
 * In this iteration we often used Google docs over Git. This caused us problems because it was hard to track changes and modify files concurrently. We will have to get used to making smaller Git changes and committing often.
 * In case of disagreement on the project direction, sometimes it's impossible to reach a compromise. In this case it's important to make sure that the side whose idea is rejected understands what was the issue with it. In order to achieve it we will stop anonymous voting.
 * We abandoned Messenger (for more important tasks) and will continue to use Slack since it has been easy to navigate.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Decided on the idea, minimum viable product.
 * Decided workflow for instructors to check plagiarism between students/internet sources.
 * Set up a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/h5mS5J5d/csc301-team-01) that we effectively used to complete the deliverables.
 * Viewed product alternatives (MOSS) to see various implementation details and how they could be incorporated into our product.
 * Read the MOSS white paper and understand their methodology at a high level: [link](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/sigmod03.pdf)
 * Understand the strengths and weakness of MOSS, identified by this article: [link](https://www3.nd.edu/~kwb/nsf-ufe/1110.pdf)
 * Completed the mock-ups we intended to create: [1](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2017/project-team-01/blob/master/designs/code_view.png?raw=true), [2](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2017/project-team-01/blob/master/designs/high_level.jpg?raw=true), and [3](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2017/project-team-01/blob/master/designs/ui_view.png?raw=true)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We weren't been able to evaluate the time it would take us to complete various back-end and front-end tasks.
   * We decided that this wasn't important at this stage. Developing algorithms will take a while and requires more research.
 * We did not decide which technologies to use.
   * We discussed Node.js for front end and Java for backend, but nothing was seriously discussed and set in stone. Again, we decided that this isn't important yet.
 * Decide on the scope.
   * Preliminarily, we decided that our product would be targetted towards instructors.
   * We found more applications of our project, like HackerRank challenges that companies give potential employees. Detecting plagiarism would eliminate much uneeded resume screening/interviews if plagiarizers were caught early. So our idea is applicable to things besides academia, so we still have to decide if we'll solely focus on academia.
 * We did not investigate any matching algorithms.
   * We did not have much time to read any current solutions in depth. We'll focus on this more once we start developing the back-end.
 
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Time management is a crucial part of development. It's extremely hard to be productive without good time management. We will need to create detailed schedules and time-lines. We'll plan to have these for the next iteration.
 * It's important to get feedback from every member of the group and meet regularly. We'll continue to stay up to date with Slack.
 * We found out that there aren't many plagirism detection tools, expect for outdated MOSS.
 * We'll find a few algorithms we can use for similarity checking. We will pool a list of algorithms and white papers that we can refer to during the next iteration.
