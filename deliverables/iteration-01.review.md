 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 13th.
 * Where: Room 2270

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

* Discussing ideas and voting on them
   * This allowed us to express our interest in pursuing ideas without the risk of groupthink.
 * Constantly pivoting different project ideas
   * This helped us flesh out a strong idea and really start to question what makes a product successful.
 * Contacting the TA often
   * Getting regular feedback from the TA allowed us to evaluate our ideas and decide how to change them.
 * Using Slack with Github integration and Trello
   * Trello makes it easier to manage tasks. We switched from Messenger to Slack because it was easier to organize our thoughts and Slack has more built-in features for collaboration.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Making voting on decisions anonymous
   * This made it more difficult in the case of tie, as well as prevented people from explaining why they voted that way.
 * Trying to get every member to pitch an idea
   * While this resulted in an abundance of ideas many were dead in the water and we wasted a fair bit of time deciding which would be feasible.
 * Meeting only once a week
   * It turned out that one meeting once a week simply wasn't enough time for us to dwell on ideas and consider what people would enjoy working on/what made the project good. Changing our meetings to twice a week (and remotely over Slack) allowed us to flush out our ideas better.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

  
 * We should have regular but shorter meetings, instead of one long weekly meeting. This will help all group members to stay on track, and make sure that we agree on where the whole project is heading.
 * We should lower our expectations. During this iteration, we spent a lot of time on some ideas that were too ambitious for a two-months project. We could improve productivity by doing small steps. 
 * In this iteration we often used Google docs over Git. This caused us problems because it was hard to track changes and modify files concurrently.
 * In case of disagreement on the project direction, sometimes it's impossible to reach a compromise. In this case it's important to make sure that the side whose idea is rejected understands what was the issue with it. In order to achieve it we will stop anonymous voting. 

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Decided on the idea, minimum viable product.
 * Decided workflow for instructors to check plagiarism between students/internet sources.
 * Viewed product alternatives (MOSS) to see various implementation details and how they could be incorporated into our product.
 * Mock version of the product:

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We weren't been able to evaluate the time it would take us to complete various back-end and front-end tasks. How long would it take to develop an algorithm for detecting similarities? How many people should we delegate to these tasks?
 * Decide on the scope. This could similarly be applied to Hackerrank challenges that companies give potential employees. Detecting plagiarism would eliminate much uneeded resume screening/interviews if plagiarizers were caught early.
 
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Time management is a crucial part of development. It's extremely hard to be productive without good time management. 
 * It's important to get feedback from every member of the group and meet regularly. 
 * We found out that there aren't many plagirism detection tools, expect for outdated MOSS.
