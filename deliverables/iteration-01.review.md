 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 13th.
 * Where: Room 2270

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 -------------------------------------
 * Using voting to pick an idea
   * This allowed us to express our interest in pursuing ideas without the risk of groupthink
 * Constantly pivoting ideas
   * This helped us flesh out a strong idea and really start to question what makes a product successful
 * Contacting the TA often
   * Getting regular feedback from the TA allowed us to evaluate our ideas and decide how to change them.
 * Using Slack with Github integration and Trello
   * Easier to manage tasks and commit code

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 -------------------------------------
 * Using anonymous voting to make decisions
   * This made it more difficult in the case of tie
 * Trying to get every member to pitch an idea
   * While this resulted in an abundance of ideas many were dead in the water and we wasted a fair bit of time deciding which would be feasible.
 * Meeting only once a week
   * We thought that this frequency plus communication online would be enough, but it turned out that caused team members to just wait until the last minute


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 
  -------------------------------------
 * We should have regular but shorter meetings, instead of few long meetings. This will help all group members to stay on track, and make sure that we agree on where the whole project is heading.
 * We should lower our expectations. During this iteration, we spent a lot of time on some ideas that were too ambitious for a two-months project. We could improve productivity by doing small steps. 
 * In this iteration we often used Google docs over git. We should utilize git more.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Decided on the idea
 * Chose the key features or project will have.
 * Decided the general role of each group member.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We weren't been able to evaluate the time it would take us to complete back-end and front-end
 * We haven't assigned the exact goals to each group member(i.e, we split a group into back-end and front-end, but not more specific)
 
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 -------------------------------------
 * In case of disagreement on the project direction, sometimes it's impossible to reach compromise. In this case it's important to make sure that the side whose idea is rejected understands what was the issue with it.
 * Time management is a crucial part of development. It's extremely hard to be productive without good time management. 
 * It's important to get feedback from every member of the group and meet regularly.
