#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * If a team member cannot make it to the meeting they will be expected to join via Skype or Google Hangouts.
 * During the meetings each team member will go over what they have done for that week.
 * We will also be communicating daily through Slack and Facebook if we have questions or concerns about our job.
 * Our team will also be utilizing a Trello Board to make sure we stay on track.

#### Artifacts

To keep track of weekly high-level goals we’ll be using Trello to manage them. To view our board please visit: [Link](https://trello.com/b/h5mS5J5d/csc301-team-01). 

Due to this being the first iteration, the only items on our agenda are: formulating a product to develop, examining the competition’s strengths and weaknesses as well as identifying any opportunities that we can pursue to make our product viable.

To keep track of specific issues related to the goals, we’ll be using the GitHub Issue Tracker, that way we’re able to assign priorities and team members their appropriate tasks. In order to identify the priority of a task we’ll be using a tagging system, the priority of the tags are as below, in descending order.
1. Critical
2. Required Component
3. Moderate
4. Needs Verification
5. Low
