# CodeLens

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: October 2nd, 2017 (first tutorial meeting)
 * End date: October 13th, 2017

## Process
During this iteration, the goal is to come up with a final concrete idea for the product. Besides organizing roles, we will figure out the target audience and the features they will need. We also need to research current solutions (if any) and identify their strengths and weaknesses in order to come up with a viable improvement.

#### Roles & Responsibilities

**Team Lead:** Ivan Topolcic
 * Responsible for organizing meetings
 * Responsible for delegating and prioritizing tasks (with team feedback of course)

**Front End Developers:** Daniel Chan, Frank Karunaratna
 * Responsible for implementing visual elements that the users will interact with
 * Will work closely with the back end team to make sure our code will integrate well

**Back End Develpers:** Patrick Gronowski, Ihor Veselovskyy, Ivan Topolcic
 * Responsible for server side logic
 * Will integrate the work of the front end team
 
**Plagiarism Detection Researcher:** David Ansermino
 * Responsible for researching and developing methods for detecting plagiarism
 * Will write the plagiarism detection module / class
 
**Code Reviewer(s):** All
 * We will review each others code periodically to make sure our code is up to standard

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * We will have weekly meetings in BA2270 to make sure all team members are up to date on their work.
 * If a team member cannot make it to the meeting they will be expected to join via Skype or Google Hangouts.
 * During the meetings each team member will go over what they have done for that week.
 * We will also be communicating daily through Facebook if we have questions or concerns about our job.
 * Our team will also be utilizing a Trello Board to make sure we stay on track.

#### Artifacts

To keep track of weekly high-level goals we’ll be using Trello to manage them. [Click here](https://trello.com/b/h5mS5J5d/csc301-team-01) to view our board.

Due to this being the first iteration, the only items on our agenda are: formulating a product to develop, examining the competition’s strengths and weaknesses, and identifying any opportunities that we can pursue to make our product viable.

We will use Facebook Messenger to facilitate online group discussion.

To keep track of specific issues related to the goals, we’ll be using the GitHub Issue Tracker, that way we’re able to assign priorities and team members their appropriate tasks. In order to identify the priority of a task we’ll be using a tagging system, the priority of the tags are as below, in descending order.
1. Critical (in case of bugs like vulnerabilities)
2. Required Component (important features for functionality)
3. Useful Features (QOL improvements like responsive design)
4. Features that are nice to have (like aesthestic changes)

Tasks will be delegated to the related subteams or to the people ahead of schedule.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Come up with a final idea for the project
 * Determine our target audience and needed features
 * Research alternative solutions for our idea
 * Create mock-ups for the UI
 * Decide which technologies to use

#### Artifacts

 * Basic images/mock-ups
   * This will give us a high level idea of what the UI could look like.
   * Not extremely important right now, but these mock-ups could give us insights into the features we want to implement.
 * Research of competition
   * Sources that identify the strengths and weaknesses of our competitors.
   * This is useful to identify the ways we can make our product viable and meaningful.
 * Algorithm research
   * Identifying similarities between files will be algorithmically intensive.
   * Look into existing algorithms and ideas like Abstract Syntax Trees. Ideally we'd be able to use an algorithm that already exists.
