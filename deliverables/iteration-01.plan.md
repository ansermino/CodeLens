# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 01

 * Start date: 6th October 2017
 * End date: 9th October 2017

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

Team Lead: The team leader organizes the meetings and goes over the lists of tasks left over or future tasks, and allocates the priority of the tasks.

Front-end Developer(s): The front-end developers are responsible for implementing visual elements that users see and interact with. They work closely with back-end developers so that their code integrates and functions as designed.

Back-end Developer(s): The back-end developers are responsible for server-side logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.

Code Reviewer(s): The code reviewer is responsible for catching any logic/styling errors created by the individual that opened the merge request. 




#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
